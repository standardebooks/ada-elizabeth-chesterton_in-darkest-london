			<h2 epub:type="title">Foreword</h2>
			<p>It is continually being said⁠—with that fatal facility which obscures the truth beyond all hope of recognition⁠—that for a woman who is willing to work, employment can always be found. Dislike of effort⁠—bone laziness it is called⁠—a vagabond love of a shiftless life, an ingrained determination to live on other people’s generosity; these are some of the reasons advanced for destitution.</p>
			<p>I have never believed in these glib assertions. I have always known that things were very different, and I determined to put my belief to the test. I decided to see what would happen if I started from zero with nothing but my personality to stand on. In the course of my travels I met with many adventures and amazing kindliness; but over and above all this, I proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that for a woman to get employment, in any recognised calling, without reference or status of some sort, is tragically impossible.</p>
			<p>How then does the outcast live?</p>
			<p>I have answered the question, in some degree at least, in these pages.</p>
